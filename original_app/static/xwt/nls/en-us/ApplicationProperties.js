        "NAM customer Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of South Carolina processes Medicare claims and, therefore, is subject to audit by the US Gov't. In the last audit, the USG auditor pointed-out that the customer must be able to specify a banner when on the log-in screen. This is a regulation. An example of what this particular customer must include in the banner upon login is indicated in the screen shot that Joan Mancini sent to Weimin Du on 10/18/2010.What we want to enable this customer and others to do is to add/replace a block of banner text in the login screen with a read only block of text containing a disclaimer or usage agreement. Thus, the customer must be able to add/replace the text with their own company specific message.This specific customer has requested that we change the existing NAM Picasso GUI in NAM 4.x, which we have agreed to do in a patch release expected in Jan. But, we're also seeking a longer-term solution via XMP. We believe BCBS is likely at the forefront of other customers who will have similar requirements. The NAM team is requesting that this feature be available by the end of this calendar year (CY10) to enable its delivery in a 1QCY11 NAM 5.x software release.",
